                    Pinguin Studioz was the name of the first 'Company' I started! It was created in early 2022, and lasted until September 2022. We had very few games, but we had very well made maps, and some okay scripting. We hired several people, including people such as Eaglesrok1 and ErikOst3. We were 'enemies' with bubbybumble, the creator of Blade Rift and The Sandwich Experience! We had a short, but very successful run, making almost 50k robux in under a year! We started with commissions and then later switched to game development.

                Project Pinguin was the first FPS game we made! It was poorly made, with nice maps. We had a good 6 developers at this time, and weren't producing enough funds, causing us to lay off a ton of employees and be left with a good 3 or so. This was before we met bubbybumble and ErikOst3. This game had very well made maps, pretty bad scripting, and a few free models, but it was our first game. Since then, I've learned to create accurate gun systems, use less scripts, and use WAY more effecient code.

                Next, we created an RPG game called Exile, this game had magic, Sword fighting, and REALLY nice builds. At this point, there were 3 of us, me, Dill, and Eaglesrok1. Two builders, one scripter. This was before I learned to use OOP and before I knew how to do much of anything with scripting. I was still pretty bad at this time, but I did know how to make a basic game. We had dashing, fighting, magic, and a small amount of VFX. Around this time, we met ErikOst3 in a RoDevs call, we asked him to help us and he agreed, he created a Stamina and sprint system for our game, but eventually became an official member of our team. ErikOst3 was a volunteer, but we didn't treat any employee or volunteer as anything less than a friend. To us, Pinguin Studioz was just a group of friends making games. We eventually stopped development of this game and moved forward with our career.

                The idea for this game wasn't ours actually, this was around the time we met bubbybumble, we played his game and really liked it. We wanted to purchase one of his games, a game called Drill Under (The) Ground or DUG. This game was very well known by a small youtubers community, it has 57.8K visits. We were going to pay 10k Robux for this game, which gave us the rights to all assets in the game, besides animations. We were at first going to build upon what he had, but after some discussing we decided to make our own. We had officially hired ErikOst3 at this point, so he was going to lead the development of this new game. I owe much of what I know about OOP to ErikOst3, the guy who taught me the basics of OOP. Our plan was to use Perlin Noise to generate a mountain and then make a system that allowed for users to drill into the terrain. It worked quite well, but we never got to far. In the end, we all slowly gave up and moved on. ErikOst3 was eventually fired due to personal arguments (we're fine now), Eaglesrok1 and I were the last two developers left and we decided to shut down the Studio. Thus came the end of Pinguin Studioz, the first company I've ever owned.

            Pinguin Studioz is something I'm very proud of founding. Over the months running it I learned more than I learned in the past 3 years. I'm very happy with how it turned out and cannot wait to create more projects similar to it.
