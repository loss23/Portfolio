                My name is Cayden also known as Loser online. I am currently 15, turning 16 on Novemeber 26th, 2022. With my years of programming I've also learned a lot about business, such as who to hire, how to trust someone, general management, time managing, and how to properly and adequately pay someone. In my yeasr on Roblox, I've done a bit of everything, from Vehicles, myth games, horror games, survival games, and even tycoon games! I plan to expand my Portfolio and range by doing commissions and earning money on the side!
